    <h2>Scandinavian Spoon Carving </h2>
    <div> <h4>Exploring Sloyd, a Scandinavian pedagogy for handcrafts, through the practice of spooncarving. </h4>
  
    <p>Sloyd (Sl√∂jd in Sweden) was established as an educational system in Finland in the 19th century. This pedagogy gained worldwide respect, it was taught in the United States until the early 20th century, and is still taught throughout Scandinavia today. Meaning 'craft' or 'handicraft' in Swedish, Sloyd is used as an educational method for many hand-based crafts including woodwork, metalwork, and fiber crafts. The principle of the Sloyd system was to incrementally build a student's skill over time through practical projects that increase gradually in difficulty. </p>

        <h3>Applying Sloyd to Spoon Carving</h3>
    <div>
    <p>The Sloyd handcraft movement as applied to woodworking prioritizes the use of green wood, wood that is freshly fallen and harvested, i.e. still wet; as opposed to kiln dried wood that is more often used in fine woodworking practice. In a Sloyd classroom, students are given a Sloyd knife, a thin, tapered blade of carbon-stell with a single bevel. In keeping with the Sloyd pedagogy, students are taught ten different grips for carving wood, starting with the easiest grip and gradually increasing in difficulty and precision. Before carving a spoon, students learn the grips through the practice of carving a butter spreader.
